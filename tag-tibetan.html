<p>
I am 61 years old and in my life I have experienced deeply several major religions - Sikhism, Chritianity and Chinee Buddhism. I have also read about most ooher spiriual practices. At the moment I am training to be a Tibetan Buddhist lama over a 3 year course and I have for the first time realised that spirituality is fun!!
</p>

<p>
All of my life, the priests have come across as being serious and miserable with sermons that admonish us in one way or other. The people in the temples and churches are quiet and deadly serious. But surely this is wrong - does not God want us to enjoy his creation? Why would he want us to be miserable and sad?
</p>

<p>
My Tibetan Buddhist lama is always laughing and smiling and making jokes. He is 70 years old but he still has the vivaciousess of a small boy. He is quite clear in his teaching: if you are not having fun and enjoying the practices, then you should not carry on training with him.
</p>

<p>
So far, as well as Tibetan Buddhist philosophy, he has taught us hundreds of meditatons. Each meditation has its own visualisations, mantras and hand mudras. My teacher says that each person is different and so they need to choose the meditations to practice that work best for them. This means that the course is never boring and my mind and body is going through continuos changes which are very surprising to me.
</p>

<p>
He says that we are effectively preparing for our deaths and that we will go through several deaths and rebirths as we continue to practice. My mood has been consistently good during the course and so I will let you know when or if I go through <b><b>a dark night of thr soul</b></b>.
