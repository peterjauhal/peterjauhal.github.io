<p>
Throughout my life I have been close to suicide several times - especially when I was 18 years old and feeling totally isolated. My life since the age of 18 has been pretty good and, especially after age 48, my life hhas been very enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
However if I died today, I would consider it a great blessing. I find it is a huge burden to keep my brain entertained and my body fit and healthy.
</p>

<p>
Dealing with the world gives me no pleasure and I have no interest in seeing the future of humanity. In fact, being a human being is a form of suffering even when we are not in physical pain. I, as well as most humans, have been betrayed, abandoned and rejected by people several times in my life - even by my parents and sister!! So living in this world is a hellish experience even when you are physically well.

So the question is: why not commit suicide? The answer is that I believe in reincarnation and so if you do commit suicide you will only have to return and complete the tour again in the future. You have to go through the tests in this world and use them to make yourself strong. As Doestoevsky says - the stars shine brightest in the darkest night. So really the human world is a quality control process to weed out the people who can survive and thrive in it without it letting them get it down. When we reach a high level of development, we should be able to experience ecstasy just in ordinary human experiences.
</p>

<p>
I am not at that level. My spritual practice does let me experience intense happiness but this is not yet consistent thoughout the day. From another point of view my spiritual practice is a form of suicide or preparation for death. And so there is no incosistency in enjoying a spiritual practice and looking forward to death - maybe that is why I enjoy my spiritual practice so much.
