<p>
Welcome to this blog! The question that I ask myself is why am I starting this blog? Does this question need an answer? Does everything we do have to hve a purpose so that we are efficient in some way? I think not. Human beings are not machines or assets that need to be made more and more efficient. We can do things which are not logical. In fact the Italian philosopher Wilfriedo Pareto actually thinks that most human actions are not based on reason.
</p>

<p>
Given this I can still provide some reasons:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I want my future self to be able to read what I was thinking at this stage in my life. So one of the rules I will follow is not to change a blog entry once I have posted.</li>
<li>I want to do something creative in my life. I consume a vast amount of information every day and it would be good to see how my brain has assimilated all of the information that I have consumed.</li>
<li>I have written a book and many poems but nowhere have I attempted to write my understanding of life.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I am not writing this blog to become popular or to have a following. It is purely for my personal use and for monitoring my self-development over the years. Of course, there are risks involved with sharing my thoughts. It is possible that some of my views may not be acceptable to the British Government now or at some point in the future and I may be arrested for expressing these views on this blog. I think this is unlikely but if it does occur I will treat this as part of my spiritual cultivation.
</p>

<p>
I do not know hwow frequently I will write - it maybe every day or once a month. We will see.
</p>

<p>
So let's start this journey into the unknown together!!
