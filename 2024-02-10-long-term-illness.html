<p>
Since 9 January 2024 I have been sick. Strangely I have not been in any pain just a huge sense of weakness and tiredness. Symptoms included a chesty cough, lots of phlegm in my system, throwing up very rarely, heavy night time sweating and a high temperature sometimes. My heart rate was in the 80s and with HRV sometimes as low as 5. I sometimes did not have the energy to eat my food and for the first few days I could not even read a book - I felt too weak. Gradually over the last month, I have been able to add most of my usual activities to my daily routine. However I made the mistake of starting my weight training too early and that set me back a lot.

<p>
Treatments that I tried incuded Lemsip, antibiotics and Epsom salt water gargling which seemed to help the most.

<p>
I am not sure how much longer this illness will last.
