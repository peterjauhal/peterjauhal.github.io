This is the second test post for my new publishing system. I've now updated the template in the n8n workflow to automatically include the Pico.css stylesheet. If this post appears with the new, modern design, it confirms that all future articles published via this method will be styled correctly right from the start. The next step is to look into a better content management interface.
