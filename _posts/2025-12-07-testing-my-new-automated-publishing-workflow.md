This is the first post published using a new automated workflow. I wrote this text inside Flowith OS, which then triggered a custom n8n workflow. That workflow took this content, formatted it, and pushed it to the GitHub repository that hosts my website, jauhal.org. If you are reading this, it means the entire automation was a success!
